This program allows to perform stress tests for slow HTTP POST attacks.

The most of thread/process-based HTTP-servers (e.g. Apache) are vulnerable for
this type of attack. Slow HTTP POST attacks can be performed by issuing a lof of
concurrent POST requests, and each of them will send POST body very slowly.

Usage example:

  slow-post.pl --concurrency=50 localhost

A list of all parameters can be obtained by running

  slow-post.pl --help

This program is AnyEvent-based, so you can easily use thousands of concurrent
connection. Also you can specify your own event loop, for example:

  perl -MEV slow-post.pl localhost
